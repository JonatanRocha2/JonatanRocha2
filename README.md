Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **DevOps Developer** with solid experience in process automation, infrastructure management and CI/CD pipeline development. My career is focused on enhancing system scalability and reliability, using a combination of automation tools, monitoring solutions, and infrastructure as code.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Skills

- **Automation and Orchestration**: Specialized in **Ansible** for server configuration and management, including complex automation of environments such as WebLogic and Kafka cluster deployments.
- **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: Proficient in **GitHub Actions** and **GitLab CI/CD**, creating pipelines that optimize the development lifecycle, break down barriers between teams, and ensure seamless integration and deployment flows.
- **Containerization and Orchestration**: Advanced knowledge in **Docker** and **Kubernetes**, with hands-on experience migrating infrastructure to Kubernetes managed with Rancher. Experienced in complex container environments and enterprise-grade solutions with OpenShift.
- **Observability and Monitoring**: Skilled in tools like **Elastic Stack (ELK)**, **Prometheus**, and **Grafana**, with expertise in implementing and configuring monitoring stacks to track system performance and ensure infrastructure visibility.
- **Scripting and Automation**: Proficient in **Python** and **Bash** for task automation and custom tool development.

## üåê Projects and Collaborations

- **Reusable CI/CD Pipeline**: Developed reusable workflows in GitHub Actions, following best practices for security and modularity across different environments.
- **GitHub Actions Importer Integration**: Working on integrating the Importer with GPT to streamline the migration of legacy CI/CD pipelines to GitHub Actions.
- **Advanced Observability**: Focused on monitoring solutions that drive high observability, helping with preventive maintenance and rapid incident resolution.
- **Strimzi Kafka on Kubernetes**: Implemented a **Kafka** cluster using the **Strimzi Operator** in Kubernetes, configured for high availability and ease of management, with automated setup and monitoring for complex Kafka operations.

## üìà Commitment to Quality and Collaboration

Currently, as part of a DevSecOps team, I'm always seeking ways to improve communication and collaboration across teams, ensuring agile and secure practices. With a technical background in mechatronics and extensive DevOps experience, I'm committed to delivering reliable and high-performance solutions.
